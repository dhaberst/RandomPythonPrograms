## Rotate

The problem was defined as:

```
Use rotation to solve this riddle:

I am a 3 digit number.
I am 129 more than the number you get when you rotate me 1/2 turn.
If you subtract 9 from me, I am equal to my 1/2 turn rotation number.
```

You can solve this using rotate.py with the following command:

```python rotate.py```
